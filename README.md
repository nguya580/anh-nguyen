# Comments ranking between gated and un-gated method.

This repo is an experiment to test if AI does play a role in filtering comments with toxicity on journalism news website.

I tested between two sets of comment on the same video. The video is published on the New York Times website which has gated comments, and their Youtube channel which has un-gated comments.

Please feel free to test out the code on your own. You will need to generate **your own API keys** from Google and The New York Times.
